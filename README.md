# NFT-Yieldoor

Automatically calculating the yields for NFT collections that have a token.

- Yield for each token is taken from @dexguru API
- NFT floors are taken from @opensea API
- Floor price + gas (0.015 ETH) is taken into consideration when calculating the ROI
- Days since minting is shown as a way to evaluate risk (Lindy effect)
